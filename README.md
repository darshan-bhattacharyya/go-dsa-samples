I am maintaining this repository for DSA samples on go, in future I plan to make these reuseable as package and also intend to add more content

The MergeSort Algorithm is usable with any kind of object be it struct or something else, all you have to do is define the compare func. Sorts either way.

The QuickSort Algorithm is newly added, It works exactly same like MergeSort, receives array of any object and comparison func needs to be defined. Sorts either way.
